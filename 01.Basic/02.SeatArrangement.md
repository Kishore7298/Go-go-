### Seating Arrangement

Akash and Vishal are quite fond of travelling. They mostly travel by railways. 
They were travelling in a train one day and they got interested in the seating arrangement of their compartment. 
The compartment looked something likeSo they got interested to know the seat number facing them and the seat type facing them. 
The seats are denoted as follows :

    Window Seat : WS
    Middle Seat : MS
    Aisle Seat : AS

You will be given a seat number, find out the seat number facing you and the seat type, i.e. WS, MS or AS.

#### INPUT
First line of input will consist of a single integer T denoting number of test-cases. Each test-case consists of a single integer N denoting the seat-number.

#### OUTPUT
For each test case, print the facing seat-number and the seat-type, separated by a single space in a new line.
```
CONSTRAINTS

    1<=T<=105
    1<=N<=108
```
``` go
package main 

import "fmt"

func getTheOpposite(seatNum int){
    var numOfCompartments int = seatNum/12
    var relativeNum12 int = seatNum %12
    var relativeNum6 int
    var relativeNum3 int
    var oppSeatType string
    seates := [3]string{"AS", "WS", "MS"}
    if relativeNum12 == 0 {
        // the number is 12 so it is a window seat
        oppSeatType = "WS"
        relativeNum12 = 12
        numOfCompartments -= 1
    } else {
        relativeNum6 = relativeNum12%6;
        if relativeNum6 == 0 {
            //6th seat 
            oppSeatType = "WS"
        } else {
            relativeNum3 = relativeNum6%3;
            if(relativeNum6 > 3){
                //4 & 5
                if(relativeNum3 == 1){
                    oppSeatType = "AS"
                } else {
                    oppSeatType = "MS"
                }
            } else {
                //1,2,3
                oppSeatType = seates[relativeNum3]
            }
        }
    }
    var oppSeatNum int = (13-relativeNum12)+(12*numOfCompartments)     
    fmt.Println(oppSeatNum,oppSeatType)
}

func main(){
    var test int;
    fmt.Scanf("%d",&test);
    for test >0 {
        test--
        var value int
        fmt.Scanf("%d", &value);
        getTheOpposite(value)
    }
}
